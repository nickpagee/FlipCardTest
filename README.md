# FlipCardTest Expo 51
Reproducible example of the flashing in sequenced flipcards since Expo 50

has different sections to help testing… 

1. Load via Media Library (we will actually be using a native module for fetching, but it is very similar to Media Library, and same issue occurs, … it was too complicated to add a native module to the example) 

2. Load via remote URLs – have noticed smaller PNGs perform better

3. Load via 'require' method
